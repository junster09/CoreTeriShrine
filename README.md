# Core Teri Shrine
## An open-source meme for learning Git and Core!

### What Is This?
Core Teri Shrine is a simple Core project that will be added onto as I try and figure out how the hell to use git and Core together.

### How do I use this?
So, Core says that you should make your own "folder" in Core if you want to collaborate using GitHub. Right now the process for getting something into this project is:
1. Fork the repo or make a new branch for yourself.
2. Create a new folder in Core marked with your name.
3. Work **ONLY** in that folder.
4. Create a pull request for your changes
